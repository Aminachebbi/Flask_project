# Flask_project
This project is about fraud detection. I have created a python project with framework Flask, and i have created two seperated pages using HTML and CSS.
Use this command to install all the frameworks and modules to run this project:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
In this project, four classification models were used: RandomForest, CatBoost, Lightgbm, and Xgboost. RandomForest was chosen for deployment. 
The feature_importances_ function was applied to the chosen model to identify the most important features, which were subsequently used again.
